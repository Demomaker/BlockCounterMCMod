 # Block Counter Mod

This minecraft mod is for counting blocks in a certain space.

Usage : `/blockcounter countblocks <firstPositionX> <firstPositionY> <firstPositionZ> <secondPositionX> <secondPositionY> <secondPositionZ> [optionalBlockFilter]`

It is recommended for now to not use this in a too big area.

With a 500 x 500 x 256 area the command goes well, but beyond that it starts getting slow and might even crash the game.

Hope you enjoy! I mostly made this for people that build things in creative mode and don't have an easy way to count blocks they placed for some kind of build they'd want to build in survival mode.
