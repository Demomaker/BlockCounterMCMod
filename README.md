 # Block Counter Mod

This minecraft mod is for counting blocks in a certain space.

Hope you enjoy! I mostly made this for people that build things in creative mode and don't have an easy way to count blocks they placed for some kind of build they'd want to build in survival mode.

Here is a video showcasing the mod :
